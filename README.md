# Entropy_Information-Gain.ipynb

Entropy comes from information theory. Entropy refers to disorder.Higher entrophy the harder it is to draw an conclusion from that information.Information gain measures how much information a features gives us about the class.Information gain is the main key is used by the decision tree algorithms to construct tree. An feature with highest information gain will tested/split test.
